## 1. Background and Purpose

This study examines predictors of health-related work absenteeism among Canadian workers with chronic conditions, using data from two cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS).

---

## 2. Data Source

### 2.1 Database

The analysis uses two cycles of the Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS), a publicly available, anonymized, nationally representative survey conducted by Statistics Canada:

- **CCHS 2010-2011** (Annual Component)
- **CCHS 2013-2014** (Annual Component)

Both cycles are available from Statistics Canada's Data Liberation Initiative (DLI) or the Research Data Centres (RDC) network. The relevant modules required are:

- **Chronic Conditions module (CCC)**: measures presence of 19 chronic conditions
- **Loss of Productivity module (LOP)**: measures days absent from work
- **Demographic and socioeconomic variables** from the main questionnaire

### 2.2 Required Variables

The following variables (or their CCHS equivalents across cycles) must be identified and extracted. Variable names may differ slightly between cycles; consult the CCHS data dictionaries.

| Category | Variable Description | CCHS Module / Notes |
|----------|---------------------|---------------------|
| **Outcome** | Days absent from work (past 3 months) – all health reasons combined (count) | LOP module – sum across all reason categories |
| **Outcome (sensitivity)** | Days absent from work due to chronic conditions only | LOP module – chronic condition reason only |
| **Primary exposure** | 19 chronic conditions (binary each): arthritis, asthma, cardiovascular disease/stroke, hypertension, fibromyalgia, diabetes, migraine, back problems, cancer, COPD, mental illness (depression/bipolar/etc.), bowel disorders, digestive diseases, chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivities, mood disorder, anxiety disorder, intestinal/stomach ulcer [check exact groupings in Appendix 3 of the thesis] | CCC module |
| **Predisposing** | Age (continuous, recoded in 3 categories: 15–24, 25–54, 55–75); sex; marital status; household size; number of children (< 5 yrs, 6–11 yrs, ≥ 12 yrs); education; immigration status; ethnic origin (White vs. visible minority); homeownership; student status | Main questionnaire |
| **Facilitating** | Household income (5 categories); province/territory of residence (11 categories); having a family doctor; employment type (self-employed vs. employee); work schedule (full-time vs. part-time); occupation category; job stress level; fruit/vegetable consumption; alcohol use; smoking status; BMI/obesity category; physical activity level | Main questionnaire |
| **Needs** | Functional limitations (activity limitations); injury status; self-perceived general health; self-perceived mental health; self-perceived health compared to prior year | Main questionnaire |
| **Survey design** | Survey weights (master weight or annual weight); bootstrap weights (500 replicates per cycle) for variance estimation; strata and cluster identifiers | CCHS sampling design files |

---

## 3. Sample Construction

### 3.1 Inclusion and Exclusion Criteria

Starting population: all CCHS respondents from both cycles pooled together.

Apply the following exclusion criteria in order, recording the sample size at each step:

- Exclude respondents aged < 15 years or > 75 years
- Exclude respondents who did not report paid employment in the past three months
- Exclude proxy respondents (i.e., where someone else answered on the respondent's behalf)
- Exclude respondents with incomplete answers on the outcome variable (LOP total days), any of the 19 chronic conditions, or any of the predictor variables

The previous analysis reports a final unweighted sample of n = 64,141 from an initial pool of 62,909 (CCHS 2011) + 63,522 (CCHS 2014). The sample selection flowchart (Figure 1) should be reproduced step by step.

### 3.2 Pooling the Two Cycles

Both CCHS cycles must be pooled into a single analytic dataset. When pooling:

- Harmonize variable names and coding schemes between the two cycles (they may differ)
- Create a cycle indicator variable (0 = 2010-2011, 1 = 2013-2014)
- Adjust survey weights: when combining two cycles, divide each respondent's original survey weight by 2 (or by the number of cycles pooled). This is the standard Statistics Canada recommendation for pooling CCHS annual cycles. Verify whether this was correctly applied.
- Combine bootstrap weights similarly
- Verify missing values that might be logically imputed. Some questions are only asked of respondents aged 18 years and older – values will be structurally missing for respondents aged 15–17 and should not be treated as uninformative missingness.

Statistics Canada recommends specific procedures for combining cycles. Consult the CCHS User Guide for the relevant years.

## 4. Outcome Variable

### 4.1 Construction

The primary outcome is the total number of workdays missed in the three months preceding the survey due to any health-related reason. This is a count variable derived from the LOP module by summing days absent across all reported health reasons:

- Chronic condition
- Injury
- Cold (runny nose, congestion, cough)
- Gastroenteritis
- Flu/influenza
- Other respiratory infection
- Other infectious disease
- Any other reason related to physical or mental health

The previous analysis specifies a minimum value of 1 day and a maximum of 90 days. Participants reporting zero days absent have the value 0 (not missing).

The sensitivity analysis uses days absent due to chronic conditions only. This restricted outcome variable should be constructed separately.

### 4.2 Distribution Checks

Before modeling, verify and report the following descriptive statistics for the outcome variable:

- Mean and standard error (weighted)
- Median, Q1, Q3 (weighted)
- Variance and standard deviation (weighted)
- Frequency and proportion of zero values
- Maximum value
- Pearson dispersion statistic (variance/mean ratio)

The previous analysis reports: mean = 1.35 (SE = 0.02), 70.59% zeros, variance = 17.7, SD = 4.19.

## 5. Analytic Plan

### 5.1 Handling Missing Data

Apply Little's MCAR test to assess the pattern of missingness across predictor variables.

- Document the proportion of missing values per variable
- Consider multiple imputation if appropriate, or treat missing values as a separate category if the proportion is small (< 5%) and the MCAR assumption holds

Suggested R package for missingness visualization: `naniar` (functions `vis_miss()`, `gg_miss_var()`, `gg_miss_upset()`).

### 5.2 Descriptive Statistics (Table 1)

Produce the following for the overall pooled sample, stratified by CCHS cycle (2011 vs. 2014):

- Unweighted frequencies and proportions for all categorical predictor variables
- Weighted frequencies and proportions (using survey weights)
- Weighted mean and standard deviation of the outcome variable (days absent)

Use the `survey` package in R to correctly account for the complex sampling design.

```r
library(survey)
design_boot <- svrepdesign(data = dat, weights = ~WGHT_FINAL,
                           repweights = boot_weights,
                           type = 'bootstrap', mse = TRUE)
```

### 5.3 Bivariate Analysis (Table 2)

For each potential predictor variable individually, fit a weighted negative binomial regression model with only that predictor and the cycle indicator, using survey weights. Report unadjusted prevalence rate ratios (PRs) and 95% confidence intervals.

⚠️  **Confidence intervals must be computed using bootstrap variance estimation** (500 bootstrap weights provided by Statistics Canada), **NOT** using standard model-based SEs with simple random sampling assumptions. Failure to use bootstrap weights will yield artificially narrow CIs.

### 5.4 Variable Selection via LASSO

The analysis uses LASSO on a Poisson model for variable selection (because standard R packages do not support LASSO for negative binomial regression directly), then transfers the selected variables to a negative binomial model.

Apply this two-stage procedure:

- **Stage 1 – LASSO on Poisson**: Fit LASSO-penalized Poisson regression using `glmnet`, with the outcome and all candidate predictors (dummy-coded). Use 5-fold cross-validation to select lambda.
- **Stage 2 – NB model**: Re-fit a weighted negative binomial regression model using only the variables retained by LASSO.

Four LASSO model specifications are to be tested:

- **Model 1**: λ_1SE, excluding perceived health variables (target: 16 variables)
- **Model 2**: λ_1SE, including perceived health variables (target: 9 variables)
- **Model 3**: λ_min, excluding perceived health variables (target: 32 variables)
- **Model 4**: λ_min, including perceived health variables (target: 33 variables)

λ_1SE = largest lambda within 1 SE of minimum CV error (more parsimonious). λ_min = lambda minimizing CV error (more predictors retained).

```r
library(glmnet)
x <- model.matrix(~ . - 1, data = predictors)  # dummy-code all predictors
cv_fit <- cv.glmnet(x, y, family = 'poisson', alpha = 1, nfolds = 5,
                    weights = survey_wts)
lambda_1se <- cv_fit$lambda.1se
lambda_min <- cv_fit$lambda.min
selected_vars <- coef(cv_fit, s = 'lambda.1se')  # non-zero coefficients
```

### 5.5 Primary Multivariable Models (Table 3)

**Identifying the main predictors of work absenteeism**

Fit four weighted negative binomial regression models using the survey-weighted design object:

- **Main Model 1 (primary)**: LASSO λ_1SE, without perceived health variables
- **Main Model 2**: LASSO λ_1SE, with perceived health variables
- **Sensitivity Model 3**: LASSO λ_min, without perceived health variables
- **Sensitivity Model 4**: LASSO λ_min, with perceived health variables

For each model, report:

- Coefficient estimates (log scale)
- Prevalence Rate Ratios (PRs) = exp(coefficient)
- 95% confidence intervals using bootstrap variance estimation
- p-values (Wald test)

The `MASS` package `glm.nb()` function does not natively integrate with the `survey` package. The recommended approach for CCHS is to use the 500 bootstrap weight replicates: re-fit the NB model 500 times using one set of bootstrap weights each time, and compute the variance of each coefficient across the 500 replications. This is the approach Statistics Canada recommends.

### 5.6 Model Performance Evaluation

Compute and report the following for each model in Section 5.5:

- AIC and BIC
- McFadden's pseudo-R² = 1 − (log-likelihood of full model / log-likelihood of null model)
- C-statistic (concordance index) for count outcomes – or Harrell's C adapted for count data
- RMSE and MAE (Root Mean Squared Error; Mean Absolute Error) computed on the withheld test fold
- 5-fold cross-validation: repeat model fitting 5 times, each time withholding 20% of data, and average performance metrics across folds

### 5.7 Condition-Specific Multivariable Models (Table 4)

**Identifying the main predictors of absenteeism within each chronic condition**

For each of the 19 chronic conditions separately, restrict the analytical sample to respondents who have that specific condition, then fit a weighted negative binomial regression model identifying the main predictors of absenteeism within that subgroup. Variable selection should follow the same LASSO procedure described in Section 5.4.

This results in 19 separate models, one per chronic condition. For each model, report:

- Sample size (unweighted n and weighted N for each condition subgroup)
- Coefficient estimates (log scale)
- Prevalence Rate Ratios (PRs) = exp(coefficient)
- 95% confidence intervals using bootstrap variance estimation
- p-values (Wald test)

⚠️  **Some chronic condition subgroups may be small** (e.g., chronic fatigue syndrome, multiple chemical sensitivities). Flag any conditions where the subgroup n < 500 (unweighted) or where the model fails to converge, and report these limitations explicitly.

The `MASS` package `glm.nb()` function does not natively integrate with the `survey` package. The recommended approach for CCHS is to use the 500 bootstrap weight replicates: re-fit the NB model 500 times using one set of bootstrap weights each time, and compute the variance of each coefficient across the 500 replications. This is the approach Statistics Canada recommends.

### 5.8 Model Performance Evaluation

Compute and report the following for each condition-specific model in Section 5.7:

- AIC and BIC
- McFadden's pseudo-R² = 1 − (log-likelihood of full model / log-likelihood of null model)
- C-statistic (concordance index) for count outcomes – or Harrell's C adapted for count data
- RMSE and MAE (Root Mean Squared Error; Mean Absolute Error) computed on the withheld test fold
- 5-fold cross-validation: repeat model fitting 5 times, each time withholding 20% of data, and average performance metrics across folds

Given potentially small subgroup sizes for some conditions, the 5-fold cross-validation may not be stable. A leave-one-out approach may be more appropriate for small subgroups – use your discretion and report the method chosen.

### 5.9 Sex-Stratified Multivariable Models (Table 5)

**Identifying the main predictors of absenteeism by sex**

Fit two separate weighted negative binomial regression models, one for female respondents and one for male respondents. Variable selection should follow the same LASSO procedure described in Section 5.4. This stratified approach allows for the identification of sex-specific predictors and highlights potential differences in the determinants of absenteeism between men and women.

For each model (female, male), report:

- Sample size (unweighted n and weighted N for each sex subgroup)
- Coefficient estimates (log scale)
- Prevalence Rate Ratios (PRs) = exp(coefficient)
- 95% confidence intervals using bootstrap variance estimation
- p-values (Wald test)

The `MASS` package `glm.nb()` function does not natively integrate with the `survey` package. The recommended approach for CCHS is to use the 500 bootstrap weight replicates: re-fit the NB model 500 times using one set of bootstrap weights each time, and compute the variance of each coefficient across the 500 replications. This is the approach Statistics Canada recommends.

### 5.10 Model Performance Evaluation

Compute and report the following for each sex-stratified model in Section 5.9:

- AIC and BIC
- McFadden's pseudo-R² = 1 − (log-likelihood of full model / log-likelihood of null model)
- C-statistic (concordance index) for count outcomes – or Harrell's C adapted for count data
- RMSE and MAE (Root Mean Squared Error; Mean Absolute Error) computed on the withheld test fold
- 5-fold cross-validation: repeat model fitting 5 times, each time withholding 20% of data, and average performance metrics across folds
