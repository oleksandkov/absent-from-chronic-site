# Absent from Chronic — Research Documentation

## Purpose

A research documentation site for the study *"Predictors of Work Absenteeism Associated with
Chronic Conditions Among Canadian Workers"* - a descriptive epidemiology study of the Loss of Productivity (LOP) module in thekl Canadian Community Health Survey (CCHS) 2010–2011 and 2013–2014 cycles.

The site provides a structured, navigable record of statistical analysis requirements, data
pipeline documentation, variable selection rationale, and exploratory descriptive findings
organized by the Andersen Behavioral Model domains. Its organizing principle is evidence: every
section corresponds to a layer of work that responds to requirements in the Project Proposal
(`stats_instructions_v3.md`).

The audience is a single expert reader (the PI) who wants to verify coverage — not a general
public site. Tone is professional and direct. Content is shown essentially as the analyst produced
it.

## Navigation

### index (Home Page)

- **Protocol**: Narrative Bridge
- **Intent**: Orient Marc-Andre with a clear statement of what this site contains and where to
  find evidence of each addressed requirement. Establish that the pipeline is built, the data is
  clean, and the five Andersen Model domains are profiled.
- **Goal**: Home page — the first thing a visitor sees.
- **Spirit**: Professional and direct. Lead with the study title and purpose, anchored by the LOP
  days distribution chart (`g01_lop_days_histogram.png`) under an **Outcome in Focus** heading.
  Include a study identification block near the top with the full study name and author line:
  Marc-Andre Blanchette, Oleksandr Koval, Andriy Koval.
  Immediately below G01, place `g23_chronic_vs_other_only_raw_split_distribution.png` to show
  distribution shape context. Show
  the pipeline architecture image (`pipeline-architecture.jpg`) to convey infrastructure maturity.
  Include a brief navigation
  guide pointing visitors to each section. No marketing language.
- **Image 1**: `analysis/eda-71/prints/g23_chronic_vs_other_only_raw_split_distribution.png` — place immediately below G01 in
  the **Outcome in Focus** section.
- **Image 2**: `images/pipeline-architecture.jpg` — copied from
  `libs/images/pipeline-architecture.jpg` by the pre-render hook.
- **Inputs**: `README.md` (project overview), `data-public/metadata/CACHE-manifest.md`
  (dataset summary: 63,843 rows, 69 columns, two CCHS cycles pooled),
  `ai/project/mission.md` (study purpose).

### Project

#### Project Proposal

- **Protocol**: Technical Bridge
- **Source**: `./data-private/raw/2026-02-19/stats_instructions_v3.md`
- **Transforms**:
  - Present the document as-is. Strip any preamble referencing internal AI agent instructions or
    repository workflow notes that are not part of the scientific content.
  - Retain all numbered sections (§1–§6), all tables, all R code blocks (these are methodology
    context relevant to the PI).
  - Do not reference `data-private/` paths in the rendered page — present as if the document is
    standalone.

---

### Pipeline

#### Pipeline Guide

- **Protocol**: Technical Bridge
- **Source**: `./manipulation/pipeline.md`
- **Transforms**:
  - Retain the pipeline flow diagram and scripts table as-is.
  - Inject mermaid shortcode where fenced mermaid blocks exist.
  - Strip R console code blocks and PowerShell commands (not relevant to PI audience).
  - Remove references to `data-private/` paths.
  - Rewrite any local file links to plain text (no paths point outside the site).

#### CACHE Manifest

- **Protocol**: Direct Line (VERBATIM)
- **Source**: `./data-public/metadata/CACHE-manifest.md`

#### INPUT Manifest

- **Protocol**: Direct Line (VERBATIM)
- **Source**: `./data-public/metadata/INPUT-manifest.md`

---

### Data Primer

#### Variable Inclusion

- **Protocol**: Direct Line (VERBATIM)
- **Source**: `./analysis/data-primer-1/variable-inclusion.qmd`
- **Note**: QMD is transferred to `edited_content/data-primer/variable-inclusion.qmd` and
  rendered as part of the Quarto site build. Strip `embed-resources: true` and `theme:` from
  YAML (inherited from site `_quarto.yml`).

#### Univariate Distributions

- **Protocol**: Direct Line (REDIRECTED)
- **Source**: `./analysis/data-primer-1/univariate-distributions.html`

---

### Analysis

- **Label**: Outcome (LOP Day Decomposition)

#### Outcome (Distribution Shapes)

- **Label**: Predisposing (Socio-demographic)

#### Facilitating

- **Protocol**: Direct Line (REDIRECTED)

- **Label**: Needs (Perceived Health & Limitations)

#### Missingness

- **Protocol**: Direct Line (REDIRECTED)
- **Source**: `./analysis/eda-65/eda-65.html`
- **Label**: Missingness

### Site Map

- **Protocol**: Narrative Bridge
- **Intent**: Help Marc-Andre navigate the site and understand what each section contains and how
  it maps to the statistical analysis requirements.
- **Goal**: Site map — an oriented index of all pages with explicit Project Proposal linkage.
- **Spirit**: Concise and functional. Structure the page in this exact order:
  **Navigation Structure**, **Content Type**, **Proposal Coverage**. In **Navigation Structure**,
  use an ASCII tree in a plain-text code block with branch-drawing characters (`├──`, `└──`, `│`)
  and consistent indentation. In **Content Type**, define each type used on the site (VERBATIM,
  REDIRECTED, TECHNICAL BRIDGE, NARRATIVE BRIDGE). In **Proposal Coverage**, link each site page
  to relevant Project Proposal section(s) and describe its current coverage status.
- **Inputs**: Contract navigation structure (this file),
  `data-private/raw/2026-02-19/stats_instructions_v3.md` (section headings for mapping).
